### Transaction Data Analysis and Dashboard Visualization

Project Summary:
This end-to-end project involved analyzing financial transaction data to uncover behavior patterns, detect anomalies, and build a professional business dashboard using **Python, MySQL, and Power BI**.


###  **Tools & Technologies Used:**

* **Python**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib,pymysql,SQLAlchemy.
* **SQL/MySQL**: Database ingestion, querying, and window function analysis
* **Power BI**: Data visualization, KPI dashboards
* **Jupyter Notebook**

---

### Project Workflow:

#### 1.  **Data Ingestion & Cleaning (Python):**

* Loaded CSV into Jupyter Notebook using pandas.
* Cleaned data: removed duplicates, checked nulls, and handled outliers.
* Extracted `Date` and `Time` from the `Timestamp` column.
* Dropped unnecessary columns for cleaner modeling.

#### 2. **Database Integration (MySQL):**

* Connected Python with MySQL using SQLAlchemy.
* Exported the cleaned dataset into MySQL.
* Executed complex SQL queries using **window functions** to analyze user growth and temporal trends.

#### 3. **Power BI Dashboard (Connected to MySQL):**

* Connected Power BI directly to MySQL to fetch the cleaned and structured data.
* Built an **interactive and attractive dashboard** including:

   **Line Chart** – Monthly transaction trend
   **KPI Cards** – Total transactions, average transaction value, etc.
   **Cards** – Weekday vs Weekend transaction share
   **Funnel Chart** – Transaction flow and drop-off analysis
   **Pie Chart** – Category or status-based distribution
   **Page Navigation Buttons** – Multi-page navigation for user-friendly UX

### **Outcome:**

This project demonstrates your ability to handle the **entire data analytics lifecycle**:

 From raw data to clean insights (Python)
 From SQL query optimization to advanced functions
 From structured MySQL storage to real-time visual dashboards (Power BI)

It’s a **portfolio-quality project** showing strong skills in **ETL, SQL analysis, data storytelling, and business intelligence**.
